# Cumulative Square Displacement (CSD)
The Cumulative Square Displacement is a novel quantitative tool that enables the detection of localized mechanical impulses acting on filamentous organelles that occur amidst the
stationary fluctuations caused by thermal jittering. We use this method to explore the forces affecting mitochondria within living cells; however, this approach can be expanded to other organelles or
biopolymers. The details of this can be found in "Deciphering the intracellular forces shaping mitochondrial motion" by Agustina Belén Fernández Casafuz, Azul María Brigante, María Cecilia De Rossi, Alejandro Gabriel Monastra and Luciana Bruno (currently in peer review). 

This repository contains an example of code used to calculate the CSD for a mitochondrion in *Xenopus laevis* melanocyte, tracked using the  JFilament **ImageJ** plugin.

The script **example.py** processes the data from **snake_img_35_m3**, calculates the CSD, k, and detects events using functions defined in **methods.py**.
